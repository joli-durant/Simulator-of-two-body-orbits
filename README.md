# Discription

This program is a simple simulator of orbits which provides an environment for users to study the movement or trajectory of a certain satellite around a star or a planet, 
to see if the results derived from the Kapler’s equations are coherent with the simulation. The program can do three kinds of simulations: 
1.	Select a central planet and a satellite from the default JCombobox bars and star the simulation.
2.	Select a central planet from the default JCombobox bar and define your own satellite to start a simulation.
3.	Start a basic simulation of the movement of the solar system by clicking the left cornered button.
Not only that we can visualize the orbits, but also during the process of the previous number 1 and 2 simulations, multiple parameters will be displayed on the left-top 
corner of the window, including the rotational angle, current coordinates, current distance between the two objects, and the total time of simulation. These numbers are 
sufficient to verify the Kapler’s eqations thus to verify the calculation of different orbits in your homework.

# Contributers

This is a student project realised by REN Baiyi and ZHONG Zhihan at INSA-Lyon year 2022 S4

# Remarks
This project is realized by two students in limited time. Therefore, the functionality remains basic and the scale of our project isn’t large. There exist some flaws 
and still a lot more to improve. During the process of the program, I would pay a huge appreciation to the prof of G96, M.Friboulet who encouraged us when we are 
struggling to find our group members, taught us the principle of “buffered image” to resolve the problem of screen flicking, also few other helpful instructions 
during the process. Without him, we cannot finish the project on time. Moreover, I would like to thank to our P2i TD (étudier la lune autour de la terre) which 
inspired us to realise this project.
